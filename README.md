### PHASE 1 PROJECT

####SPECIFYING THE DATA ANALYTIC QUESTION

Microsoft have been seeing other companies creating video content and have
decided to create a new movie studio,but they do not know how to create movies.


#### PROBLEM STATEMENT
You as a data scientist have to understand the movie industry what it is about and what it entails. What kind/types of 
films are currently trending at the box office. You must gather the findings into actionable insights and visuals, so that
the Stakeholders can undertstand what/ the kind of films that their target audience like and to know which movies that they
should invest more in.

###DATA UNDERSTANDING
Th e data files that contain the tables have various details, whereby some are irrelevant while others are relevant. As a data 
scientist you choose which data you want want to keep and which one you want to drop. The data also has iformation about how 
other films were successful,the year and also which are the studios that are in the market.
 

###DATA PREPARATION
Look at the data that we have been provided with, find the missing values ,look for anomalies/outliers, look for the
information at the head and the tail of the table provided and think critically before dropping a row or column. This
means understand it then analyse it. This way you are able to get more than enough informatiion.

###DATA ANALYSIS
we have been provided with data from different movie files that contain data. From the data that was provided it involved
things that have to be put into consideration. This things are :-
  
 - What kind of movies or genre do people like?
 
 - Do movies give a good return in terms of profit? Yes they do. When you look at our data you an see the amount that was used in 
 the production and the amount they received as gross both domestically and locally and the profit was good.
 
 - what are the ratings of the movie and do they affect anything?
 - which studios are your competitors in the industry?
